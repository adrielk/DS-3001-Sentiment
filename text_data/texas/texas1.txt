Texas Tech Professor Katharine Hayhoe, one of the foremost climate science experts in the world, appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live Wednesday evening to talk climate change and communication.
She was promoting her new book, "Saving Us: A Climate Scientist's Case for Hope and Healing in a Divided World."
Hayhoe is the co-director of the Texas Tech University Climate Center and is the Endowed Professor in Public Policy and Public Law in the Texas Tech Political Science Department.
Kimmel talked with Hayhoe about her life as a climate expert in the middle of conservative oil country, and the intersection of her evangelical beliefs with climate change science.
Late night comedy hosts coordinated efforts Wednesday to produce shows with elements dedicated to the effects of climate change. In other words, it was Climate Night.
The topics ranged from The Daily Show with Trevor Noah tackling sea turtle gender in a segment dedicated to little known consequences of climate change, to Late Night with Seth Meyers devoting his Closer Look segment to the Green New Deal and fossil fuel lobbyists.
Talking about the impacts of climate change is exactly what Hayhoe said society should be doing.
"There is one thing that everyone can do, and we're not doing it," she told Kimmel, who asked her what that was.
"Talk about it," Hayhoe said. "Only 14% are actually talking about it. And if you don't talk, why would you care? And if you don't care, why would you do anything about it?"
In 2014, Hayhoe was named to the TIME 100, Time Magazine's list of influential people for 2014, according to A-J Media archives.
In 2017 and 2018, Hayhoe played a key role as the lead author of the first and second volumes of the Fourth U.S. National Climate Assessment published by the U.S. Global Change Research Program, as well as participating in the Nobel Peace Prize forum and giving a TED Talk on climate solutions that has received more than 1.9 million views.
Hayhoe also was awarded the eighth Stephen H. Schneider Award for Outstanding Climate Science Communication in 2018.
In 2017, she was named one of Fortune's 50 Greatest World Leaders, which honors men and women across the globe who are helping to change the world and inspiring others to do the same. In 2016, she was named to the annual Politico 50 list, which recognizes those in society who help shape policy and thinking in the U.S.
The full episode of Wednesday's Jimmy Kimmel Live can be streamed on Hulu, however, Hayhoe's appearance can be found for free on Youtube
